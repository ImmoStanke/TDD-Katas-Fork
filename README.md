# Introduction

This repository contains a base repository leveraging the following:

1. Typescript
1. Jest for testing

A Sample module `src/sample.ts` has been configured along with it's associated test `__tests__/sample.test.ts`.

Another class `src/person.ts` has been added to demonstrate TDD with some skipped tests. Try to fix it!

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
```

## Running Tests

```sh
npm t -- --watch **/person.test.ts

npm t -- --watch

npm t
```
